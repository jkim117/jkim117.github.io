        <p>I was born and raised in Washington State and graduated as the Valedictorian from Camas High School in 2017. During my time in high school, I was an active member of the school Knowledge Bowl team, Portland Youth Philharmonic Orchestra, and was the captain of the school Science Olympiad Team and president of the Southwest Washington Red Cross youth chapter.</p>
        <p>My undergraduate education was at Princeton University where I majored in Computer Science. I graduated with Summa Cum Laude and Sigma Xi honors. During my time at Princeton I was a trip leader for Outdoor Action (a backpacking/leadership organization on campus), and an advising fellow for Matriculate (an organization dedicated to helping first generation, low-income, high school students apply and find affordable options for college).</p>
        <p>While at Princeton, I had the privelege to conduct research under the guidance of Dr. Hyojoon Kim and Professor Jennifer Rexford, creating a data-plane program to analyze network traffic by domain name. In addition, I interned at Google as part of the Google Play team and conducted research under Professor Joel Hartman at the Princeotn Astrophysics Department.</p>
